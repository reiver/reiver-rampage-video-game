**Rampage** is a video game from the mid- 1980s.

The main characters of the video game were **3 giant monsters** —

• a giant gorilla — that is reminiscent of King Kong,
• a giant (bipedal) reptile — that is reminiscent of Gozilla, but is said to be inspired by Ymir from The Beast from Space, and
• a giant (bipedal) werewolf.

I was familiar with both King Kong and Gozilla when I first saw the **Rampage** video game.
One thing I liked about the Rampage video game is that, it added the third giant moster — the giant (bipedal) werewolf.

I still think about the **Rampage** video game and its 3 main characters from time to time 🙂
