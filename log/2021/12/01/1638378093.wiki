**Rampage** is a video game from the mid- 1980s.
I think it came out in the year 1986.

The main characters of the video game were **3 giant monsters** —

• a giant gorilla — that is reminiscent of //King Kong//,
• a giant (bipedal) reptile — that is reminiscent of //Gozilla//, but is said to have been inspired by //Ymir// from //The Beast from Space//, and
• a giant (bipedal) werewolf.

I was familiar with both King Kong and Gozilla when I first saw the **Rampage** video game.

Back then, one thing I liked about the Rampage video game is that, it added a third giant moster — the giant (bipedal) werewolf.

I still think about the **Rampage** video game and its 3 main characters from time to time 🙂
